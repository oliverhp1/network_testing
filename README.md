# network_testing

Goal: using java, one render, one event, and one client <-> server message

for connecting client to server: execute multi with port (e.g. 7777), then telnet <localhost or ip> <port>

client server message done. different machines is just using <ip address> instead of "localhost".  
then on different wifi?
or can same wifi be acceptable
